## Author: Kenneth Hancock

Pretty simple server to allow mutiple people to work on one Arduino chip my uploading to a server connected to the arduino chip.

## This tool is not completed yet -- Its very rough right now.

To run type the following from within the directory:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
